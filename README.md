# Worker Runtimes

* Table of Contents
{:toc .large-only}

## Origin

Worker Runtimes are an **adaptation** of the [Service Workers API][sw], which is a browser standard for offline web applications. To give web developers more freedom over offline experiences, the specification includes a (minimal) HTTP server. Since it was published, **other vendors have implemented this API** for servers that run in the cloud — or on the edge in the case of [Cloudflare Workers][cw].

Typically, they also implement other browser APIs such as Fetch, Streams, and Web Cryptography, making their global scope similar to that of a Service Worker. We call them _Worker Runtimes_ or _Worker Contexts_. 

To see which vendors and APIs are available, check out the [State of Worker Runtimes](#state-of-worker-runtimes){:.heading} below. 

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(new Response('Hello World', {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }
  }));
})
```

*Since originally writing this, both Deno and Cloudflare Workers have dropped support for the pattern shown above.*
*While the `Request` and `Response` classes remain, the global `fetch` event and `respondWith` method do not.*
*The reasons are difficult to ascertain, but it seems it was deemed too confusing for beginners.*

## State of Worker Runtimes
Last modified at: {{ page.last_modified_at | date:"%b %d %Y" }}
{:.heading.post-date}

There are currently two production quality Worker Runtimes. There are multiple offline, testing, and development implementations.
[Cloudflare Workers][cw] was the first, and is the most battle-tested Worker Environment. 
[Deno Deploy][dd] is a close second.

### Browser APIs

The center piece of any Worker Environment is an implementation of the global `fetch` event. 
Implementations of other browser APIs are necessary for bridging the gap between different worker runtimes.

### Working Drafts
The APIs below are either abandoned or do not have buy-in from major browser vendors. However, they can still be reasonable targets for 3rd party libraries, such as KV stores or cookie middleware.

## Backend for Frontend
Worker Runtimes fulfill the original promise of NodeJS: To use one language and share code between client and server. In practice, this never came to be. Instead the APIs of node and browsers have diverged[^1]. Worker Runtimes are bringing them back together.  

This is good news for Frontend Developers in particular: The knowledge acquired for building (offline) web applications can now be applied to writing HTTP servers --- and so can the tools:

[^1]: Node and the browser have diverged due to a lack of browser APIs for many crucial components, including HTTP, streams, file access, and more more. A lot has changed since then. Standards have been written for all of these and more, often informed by the experience of using the node-equivalent.

[![Worker Tools Logo](./assets/img/tools.svg){:width="120" height="120"}][wt]{:.no-mark}
{:.centered style="margin:3rem auto -3rem"}

## Tools

No HTTP Server is complete without a web framework for common tasks such as routing, sessions, authentication, and more. 
<!-- Unfortunately, Worker Runtimes do not have a framework at the level of polish that is common in Node.js, yet. -->

[__Worker Tools__][wt] is a collection of tools and libraries for writing web servers, built specifically for Worker Runtimes.
They can be used independently, or as a complete framework via [__Shed__][wts].
